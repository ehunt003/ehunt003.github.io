        <p>This website exists as an archive of and a reflection on my undergraduate education at the University of Washington. Created to fulfill the required Interdisciplinary Honors portfolio, it contains artifacts and reflections from courses, including Honors courses, as well as personal and professional events spanning all four years. Read my learning statement, or explore entries by year or on the timeline.
